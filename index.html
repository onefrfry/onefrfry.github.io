<h2>Details</h2>
<p>During development of the original game, I had done the enemies and their resepective AIs, worked on the room transitions and overall game authenticity with the map/enemy placement, added cheat codes, and did a lot of QA testing! </p>
<p>For our custom level, I had build the second half of the rooms (ones towards the top) and mainly bug fixed, QA tested, and did some balancing.</p>
<p>All of this was built using C# and Unity.</p>

<h3>Personal Project</h3>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>I had built the entire game from start to finish! I had came up with the idea, planned out how it would work, did the level design, wrote all of the logic, etc.</p>
<p>Basically everything to do with programming and game design was done by me. However, the sounds, music, and art were borrowed assets with appropriate credit from sources not listed as public domain in the credits link above! </p>
<p>I am honestly proud of this, but there is still much more that could be done and more I wanted to do in this 2 week sprint project. Nonetheless, enjoy!</p>

<h2>Details: CSE Simulator</h2>
<p>During development of the original build for milestone and alpha, I had done the whiteboards, fire alarms, doors, placed many of the assets, QA tested, and dealt with the lighting on the outside and inside. </p>
<p>During development for the application for Gold, I had mainly added the scenery, polished up old features and bug tested!</p>
<p>This was made using Unreal Engine 5.0.3 through their visual scripting system!</p>
<p>The entire project of coruse was developed by me (Samuel Bohnett) and Patrick Halim (pnhalim)!</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>During development of the original game, I had done the enemies and their resepective AIs, worked on the room transitions and overall game authenticity with the map/enemy placement, added cheat codes, and did a lot of QA testing! </p>
<p>For our custom level, I had build the second half of the rooms (ones towards the top) and mainly bug fixed, QA tested, and did some balancing.</p>
<p>All of this was built using C# and Unity.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>During development of the original game, I had done the enemies and their resepective AIs, worked on the room transitions and overall game authenticity with the map/enemy placement, added cheat codes, and did a lot of QA testing! </p>
<p>For our custom level, I had build the second half of the rooms (ones towards the top) and mainly bug fixed, QA tested, and did some balancing.</p>
<p>All of this was built using C# and Unity.</p>

<h2>Details: CSE Simulator</h2>
<p>During development of the original build for milestone and alpha, I had done the whiteboards, fire alarms, doors, placed many of the assets, QA tested, and dealt with the lighting on the outside and inside. </p>
<p>During development for the application for Gold, I had mainly added the scenery, polished up old features and bug tested!</p>
<p>This was made using Unreal Engine 5.0.3 through their visual scripting system!</p>
<p>The entire project of coruse was developed by me (Samuel Bohnett) and Patrick Halim (pnhalim)!</p>
